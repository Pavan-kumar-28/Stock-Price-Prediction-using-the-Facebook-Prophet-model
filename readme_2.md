Stock price prediction is a challenging task, but the Facebook Prophet model is a powerful tool for making accurate predictions. Prophet is a time-series forecasting model developed by Facebook, which is designed to handle trends, seasonality, and outliers in time-series data.

To use the Prophet model for stock price prediction, you can follow these steps:

1. Collect the historical data: First, you need to collect the historical stock price data for the company whose stock price you want to predict. You can get the data from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance or Google Finance.

2. Prepare the data: Next, you need to prepare the data for the Prophet model. The data should have two columns: "ds" for the date and "y" for the stock price. You may also need to remove any missing values and outliers from the data.

3. Create the Prophet model: After preparing the data, you can create a Prophet model using the Prophet library in Python. You can set the parameters such as the number of years to predict, the frequency of the data, and the seasonality.

4. Fit the model: Once you have created the Prophet model, you need to fit it to the historical data. The model will automatically detect any trends, seasonality, and outliers in the data and adjust the parameters accordingly.

5. Make predictions: Finally, you can use the fitted model to make predictions for future stock prices. You can use the predict() method to get the predicted stock prices along with the uncertainty intervals.

In this code, we first load the historical stock price data from a CSV file. We then rename the columns to "ds" and "y" and convert the "ds" column to a datetime format. We create the Prophet model and fit it to the data. We then make predictions for the next 365 days and plot the predicted stock prices.
